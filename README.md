# Rising Of The Zombie Pig

***This mod will not continue to be updated.***

This mod adds the function of being able to turn pigs into zombie pigs.
When feeding Rotten Flesh to the pig there is a small chance that it will transform.
Also this transformation is somewhat unstable and it may be that the pig disappears and takes a tour of the old nether before returning.
